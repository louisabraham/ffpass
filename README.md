# ffpass - Import and Export passwords for Firefox Quantum

The latest version of Firefox doesn’t allow to import or export the
stored logins and passwords.

This tools interacts with the encrypted password database of Firefox to
provide these features.

## Installation

ffpass requires Python 3.6+ and will work with Firefox 58+

``` bash
pip3 install ffpass
```

## Features

  - Supports master passwords
  - Automatic profile selection for Linux, macOS and Windows
  - Export to CSV
  - Import from CSV compatible with Google Chrome

> Note: Firefox must be closed during the whole process, as these
> actions change its database. 
>
> Note: If you have Sync enabled, you'll have to disconnect and
> reconnect your Firefox account after importing the passwords.

## Export to CSV

``` bash
ffpass export > passwords.csv
ffpass export -t passwords.csv
ffpass export --to passwords.csv
```

### Usage

    usage: ffpass export [-h] [-t TO_FILE] [-d DIRECTORY] [-v]
    
    outputs a CSV with header `url,username,password`
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -t TO_FILE, --to TO_FILE
      -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY, --dir DIRECTORY
                            Firefox profile directory
      -v, --verbose

## Import from CSV

``` bash
ffpass import < passwords.csv
ffpass import -f passwords.csv
ffpass import --from passwords.csv
```

By default, it works with the passwords exported from Google Chrome.

### Usage

    usage: ffpass import [-h] [-f FROM_FILE] [-d DIRECTORY] [-v]
    
    imports a CSV with columns `url,username,password` (order insensitive)
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -f FROM_FILE, --from FROM_FILE
      -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY, --dir DIRECTORY
                            Firefox profile directory
      -v, --verbose

## Troubleshoot

  - `ffpass export: error: the following arguments are required:
    -d/--directory/--dir`
    
    It means one of the following (launch with option `--verbose` to
    know):
    
      - Automatic profile selection is not supported for your platform.
      - There is more than one user profile for Firefox.
    
    You have to provide the `--dir` option with your Firefox Profile
    Folder. To find it, follow these
    [instructions](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data#w_how-do-i-find-my-profile)
    on the website of Firefox.

  - `Firefox password database is empty. Please create it from Firefox.`
    
    It means that Firefox currently doens't store any password. `ffpass`
    cannot create the password database for security reasons. Just add
    one password manually to Firefox to create the database.

  - `TypeError: 'PosixPath' object is not iterable`
    
    See [\#17](https://github.com/louisabraham/ffpass/issues/17).

  - Empty url field in Firefox after importing: the urls of the source
    csv file must begin with a scheme (`http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`,
    etc…)
    
  - Passwords do not sync to other devices, including Lockwise app.

    Importing passwords break the sync. You'll have to disconnect the
    Firefox account in the Sync options and the re-add it.
